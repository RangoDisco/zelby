# What it is

Discord bot created in order to keep me accountable for my daily fitness related tasks. \
Each day I can call the bot the check if I have completed my goals for the day. These goals are:

- 1h gym session
- 1h of cardio (can be soft, like walking)
- Less than 2100kcal consumed
- More than 1000kcal burned
- More than 2L of water drank

If one of these goals is not met, the bot will pick a winner from the registered users and I will this person 5‚Ç¨.\
Each goal is dynamic and can be changed at any time (depending on my objectives). \
